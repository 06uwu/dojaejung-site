            <h2>Mini-Film Series</h2>
            <p>For Perfume, the trio created a mini-film series as a promotion called 'Triangular Theory of Love.' Each

            <h3 class="title-films">#PASSION Jaehyun</h3>
            <p>In the Triangular Theory of Love, Jaehyun plays a culinary chef going through a recent breakup.
                While working in the kitchen, time passes, and he is constantly consumed by thoughts of his
                former lover. At one point, his phone lights up—a message... it's from her... This scene
                highlights the intense passion and longing he still feels for her, aligning with the 'Passion'
                theme in the triangular theory of love. The triangular theory of love, developed by psychologist
                Robert Sternberg, identifies three components of love: passion, intimacy, and commitment. In
                this context, 'Passion' represents the intense emotions and physical attraction Jaehyun
                experiences.</p>

            <h3 class="title-films">#COMMITMENT Doyoung</h3>
            <p>Doyoung is lost in thought, reminiscing about a visit to the beach with a loved one. The film
                portrays his reflections on this memory, emphasizing his longing and commitment to this person.
                This scene highlights the 'Commitment' component in the triangular theory of love, which
                represents the decision to maintain a long-term relationship and the responsibility that comes
                with it. The triangular theory of love, developed by psychologist Robert Sternberg, identifies
                three components of love: passion, intimacy, and commitment. In this context, 'Commitment'
                represents the determination and responsibility Doyoung feels in his relationship.</p>

            <h3 class="title-films">#INTIMACY Jungwoo</h3>
            <p>Jungwoo plays a high school student who shares a close friendship with his classmates, portrayed
                by Jaehyun and Doyoung. The film depicts Jungwoo's daily school life and his growing feelings
                for a special person, with whom he constantly exchanges messages. At one point, the
                communication stops, leaving Jungwoo feeling sad. His friends encourage him to reach out, and
                eventually, he reunites with his loved one, highlighting their deep emotional bond and
                closeness.
                This film illustrates the concept of 'Intimacy' in the triangular theory of love, developed by
                psychologist Robert Sternberg. Intimacy refers to feelings of closeness, connection, and
                attachment within a relationship. It represents the emotional depth and trust that partners
                share with each other.</p>
